//! Turn context — pure data struct passed to turn-end hooks.

//! agent-base does not build, aggregate, or persist metrics. It only exposes
//! raw turn data through the [`on_turn_end`](crate::AgentRuntime::on_turn_end)
//! hook. Consumers (e.g. phi-telemetry) build their own metrics from this context.
